The JHelioViewer project is an initiative of the ESA to observe the
Sun. Currently, there is a utility (http://jhelioviewer.org) that
allows the remote viewing of the images, although not in real time. In
this project, a new tool is developed which can be used to visualize
the images that have just been taken, using a standard Web client
(such as Firefox).
